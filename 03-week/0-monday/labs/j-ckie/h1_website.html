        <h1>I am having the worst allergy attack right now.</h1>
        <h2>Someone in the class is wearing cologne/perfume that I am <em>highly</em> allergic to right now.</h2>
        <h6>If I find out who put on a fresh layer of cologne/perfume, I might honestly go out of my way to sneeze on them because who puts on a large amount of fragrance right before secluding themselves in a small room with 20 other individuals??</h6>        
        <h2>This situation wouldn't be as bad if I wasn't trying to recover from being sick, but my sinuses are being aggravated even more now than this morning <em>which means they literally just put on a fresh spritz because I was perfectly fine all morning</em>.</h2>
        <h6>Seriously though, whoever put on cologne/perfume during lunch, I really don't like you right now.</h6>
        <h3>Sincerely,
            <br>
            - Tired of Sneezing
        </h3>
