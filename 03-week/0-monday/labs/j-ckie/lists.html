<!--Here's what I like about lists:

They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
That's about it
I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
When you make a list, do it in this order:

Decide if it's an ordered list or not
If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other
You've got this, I believe in you!-->
