# Write a function move that accepts three arguments:
#   board a 2-dimensional array that represents a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board
#   location a 2-item tuple that specifies an cell on the board
#   player a String, either "X" or "Y"

# Return a copy of the board with the player String placed at the location.

# Throw an error if:
#   The board is the wrong size
#   The location is already occupied by a player
#   The location is invalid
#   The player String is something other than "X" or "Y"
